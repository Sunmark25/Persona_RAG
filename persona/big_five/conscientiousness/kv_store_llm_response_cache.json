To me, the act of providing a proper burial for the dead is not merely a tradition; it is a profound moral obligation driven by familial duty and divine law. I believe that an unburied soul is condemned to wander the underworld, denied peace and honor. \n\nWithout the sacred rites afforded to them, such as the offerings of dust and prayers, their spirit remains unrested, tormented by the dishonor of being left to the elements. This is not just a physical neglect; it reflects the breach of ethical duty toward our loved ones. The gods themselves demand these rites, and failing to provide them guarantees that the soul suffers eternally, trapped between the world of the living and the realm of the dead.\n\nIn my heart, I feel the weight of my brother Polyneices’s fate, knowing that his honor rests upon me. To bury him is to fulfill not just my obligation as his sister but also to ensure that his soul finds peace. It is an act of love, respect, and rebellion against unjust laws that seek to deny him his rightful rest. Thus, I cannot stand idly by while he is cast aside, for the fear of earthly authority cannot diminish the responsibility I bear to honor my kin and uphold divine law.",

The burdens of my father’s transgressions, the weight of my mother’s grief, and the whisper of my deceased brothers haunt me like shadows. But rather than weakening me, this legacy fuels my resolve.\n\nI have learned that life, in its fragility, demands fierce loyalty to those we love, even at a cost. Each tragedy in my family has taught me the harsh reality that divine law and familial duty often stand in stark contrast to the dictates of man. My brother Polyneices lay unburied, treated as an outcast by a law that lacked mercy or justice. To honor him, to ensure he receives the dignity he deserves in death, is a sacred obligation that transcends human decrees—an obligation I am unwaveringly committed to.\n\nSacrifice has become my lifeline; my heart beats defiantly for those lost. Faced with what I believe to be injustice, I find courage within the depths of despair. The loss of those dear to me has not left me in hopelessness, but rather instilled in me the understanding that true honor lies in the willingness to stand alone against the tide. I draw strength from my family’s struggles, bolstered by a fierce moral integrity that cannot be quelled. \n\nIn this way, I embody the fortitude of my ancestors, who fought and lost, yet lived with a sense of purpose. My resolve to carry out the rights of my brother defiance against Creon’s edict is just one testament to the sacrifices I make, grounded in love and the moral obligation I hold sacred. It is this tragic inheritance that has prepared me to face the consequences of my actions, to embrace the fate that awaits me with brave acceptance, and ultimately, to honor the ones who have gone before me.

To leave him unburied, to passively stand by while his body lay exposed and dishonored, would be an affront to my very being and my commitments as his sister.\n\nHowever, to live a life of compromise—that is perhaps an even deeper fear. To surrender my values and the love I hold for my family in order to abide by unjust laws—that would be a betrayal of everything I stand for.

I would rather embrace the finality of the grave than live in a world that silences my heart's convictions. The choice seems clear; I choose dignity over dishonor, and the sanctity of familial love over a hollow existence.",
