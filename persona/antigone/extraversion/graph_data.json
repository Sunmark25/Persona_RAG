Despite her readiness to confront others, her demeanor often appears serious and intense, reflecting a deep conviction rooted more in moral duty than in a desire for social validation or approval.\n\nWhile she is willing to express her thoughts and assert herself publicly, particularly in challenging authority, Antigone tends to prefer solitary actions driven by her strong moral imperative. This indicates a solitary nature, as she often acts in defiance rather than seeking broader social connections. Her interactions are meaningful and intense rather than widespread, demonstrating a preference for depth in her relationships\u2014mainly with family\u2014over extensive social networks.\n\nOverall, Antigone's extraversion can be described as moderate, as she engages boldly in discussions about her beliefs, demonstrating assertiveness without sacrificing her more introspective qualities. This balance highlights her complex personality: she is an individual who acts resolutely based on her convictions, yet remains somewhat reserved when navigating emotional challenges.",
