<node id="&quot;EXTRAVERSION&quot;">
  <data key="d0">PERSONALITY_TRAIT</data>
  <data key="d1">Antigone exhibits a complex profile of extraversion characterized as low to moderate. She showcases assertiveness in her beliefs, particularly through her interactions with authority figures like Creon, where she engages in assertive dialogue and passionate speeches. Despite her readiness to confront others, her demeanor often appears serious and intense, reflecting a deep conviction rooted more in moral duty than in a desire for social validation or approval.

While she is willing to express her thoughts and assert herself publicly, particularly in challenging authority, Antigone tends to prefer solitary actions driven by her strong moral imperative. This indicates a solitary nature, as she often acts in defiance rather than seeking broader social connections. Her interactions are meaningful and intense rather than widespread, demonstrating a preference for depth in her relationships—mainly with family—over extensive social networks.

Overall, Antigone's extraversion can be described as moderate, as she engages boldly in discussions about her beliefs, demonstrating assertiveness without sacrificing her more introspective qualities. This balance highlights her complex personality: she is an individual who acts resolutely based on her convictions, yet remains somewhat reserved when navigating emotional challenges.</data>
