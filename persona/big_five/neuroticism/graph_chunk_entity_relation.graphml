  <data key="d0">PERSONALITY_TRAIT</data>
  <data key="d1">Antigone is characterized by a complex portrayal of agreeableness, predominantly reflecting high levels of this trait through her deep loyalty, empathy, and commitment to her family. Her actions demonstrate an innate sense of duty, particularly in her willingness to sacrifice her own life for her moral convictions and her steadfast commitment to honoring her deceased brother. Antigone's high agreeableness is evident in her prioritization of familial bonds, as she emphasizes love and loyalty over societal rules, showcasing altruism and a strong sense of responsibility towards her family.

While many descriptions highlight her as displaying high agreeableness, there are also indications of moderate agreeableness due to her stubbornness and rigid adherence to her beliefs. This complexity suggests that although she is supportive and loyal, her strong sense of justice sometimes puts her at odds with authority figures, leading to conflicts especially with characters such as Ismene and Creon. Antigone's empathy shines through as she endures personal suffering and accepts consequences for her actions, making her appear both compassionate and uncompromising.

Overall, Antigone's agreeableness can be summarized as primarily high, marked by her dedication to family values and the moral integrity reflected in her courageous choices. However, her interactions with authority and her unyielding nature introduce elements of moderate agreeableness, illustrating the nuanced dynamics of her relationships and motivations.</data>
