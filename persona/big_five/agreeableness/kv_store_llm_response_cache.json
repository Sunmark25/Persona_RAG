      "return": "As Antigone, I hold a profound belief drawn from my deep respect for the divine laws that govern both the living and the dead. I am compelled by the conviction that to leave a body unburied is a grievous injustice, not solely to the flesh that remains but to the very soul of the deceased. \n\nIn my understanding, an unburied soul faces endless suffering, trapped between worlds. The Greeks, in their piety and respect for the gods, uphold the belief that the soul cannot enter the realm of the dead without proper burial rites. It is as if this act of forgetting or denying the dead's humanity binds their spirit to the earth, leaving them restless and in agony. Such a fate is not to be taken lightly, for it defies the natural order and the sacred rituals passed down to us.\n\nThe weight of this knowledge presses heavily upon my heart, driving me to honor my brother Polynices, who deserves to have his soul find peace after such a violent end. I believe that, through my actions, I not only fulfill my moral duty as his sister but also uphold the sacred respect for the divine which mandates proper burial as the key to the afterlife's acceptance. The gods observe our deeds, and I am resolute in my belief that to honor the dead is to acknowledge their existence and maintain the harmony of the cosmos. \n\nTherefore, it is unthinkable for me to leave my brother unburied while I draw breath, for that choice not only condemns him but also shatters the very principles of loyalty and duty that I hold dear. This truth anchors my resolve, guiding me through the defiance I must undertake against the unjust edicts of men like Creon.",

The laws of the gods, as I understand them, demand that I give him a proper burial, for without this act, his spirit cannot find peace in the afterlife. \n\nIn moments of torment, I grapple with my duty. I think, *Is it not my unwavering loyalty to those I love that defines who I am?* The dictates of the state may wield power, but they pale in comparison to the moral truth that compels me to act. I often reflect upon the greatness of familial bonds, cherishing the idea that loyalty to my kin is my highest calling. I have seen how the gods favor those who honor their blood and do what is right, regardless of earthly decrees. \n\nThus, I comfort myself with the knowledge that in standing for my family’s honor, I embody a greater justice, one that transcends the immediate consequences of disobedience. I understand the weight of my actions; they will bring suffering and pain, yet I also know that fidelity to my values is the very foundation of my identity. In choosing to defy the state, I choose to uphold the laws written in my heart by the divine — and that, to me, is the only path I can take.

This sense of inherited struggle has equipped me with a conviction to act, even when faced with unimaginable sacrifice. My brother Polynices, denied the sacred rites of burial by Creon's decree, has become a symbol of the honor that must be upheld—no matter the personal cost. In my heart, I know that the price of failure to honor him would tarnish not just my family's legacy but also my own soul. \n\nSuch a heavy legacy has imbued me with resilience. When others hesitate, afraid of the repercussions of defying authority, I have learned to embrace my role as a guardian of family loyalty, even to the point of confrontation. The fear of death, which many might see as a deterrent, only strengthens my resolve. I recognize that to remain silent or compliant in the face of injustice would be an affront to my brother's memory and to the very essence of my being. \n\nIn essence, my family's history has fortified my sense of justice and duty. It drives me to make the sacrifices others often cannot fathom, leading me to act on values rooted deeply in love, loyalty, and moral principle. It is a heavy mantle, yet one I wear with determination—knowing that to honor the dead is to pave a righteous path for the living, even when that path leads to my own ruin.",

The very essence of who I am is rooted in my unwavering devotion to my family and my fierce commitment to uphold what is right according to divine law.\n\nTo compromise my values, to abide by a law that forbids the honorable burial of my loved one, would mean betraying not just Polynices, but also myself. It would strip away my dignity and reduce my existence to one defined by fear and submission. Living life without the courage to stand for what is just, to turn my back on familial loyalty for the sake of ease or societal acceptance—this is the true tragedy.\n\nSo no, I would welcome an unmarked grave, for it could carry the quiet confidence of having acted with integrity and moral conviction. A grave that bears no mark is a resting place, but a life spent in compromise is a grave within the living world—a sepulcher of the spirit, buried under the weight of obedience to unjust authority. I would rather face death standing firm in my beliefs than live shackled by the chains of indecision and fear.
