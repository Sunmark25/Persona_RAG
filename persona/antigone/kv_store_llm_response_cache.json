A description of how each trait is exhibited (detailing how the character's behaviors and dialogue reflect the trait).\n2. Supporting excerpts from the novel that illustrate the trait.\n3. A causal relationship explanation that describes the events or interactions triggering these trait expressions (e.g., character interactions, plot twists).\n4. Create a comprehensive personality profile centered around the Big Five dimensions that forms the backbone of the knowledge graph.\nUse English as output language.\n\nNote: Refer to the following Big Five personality dimensions and their associated facets for trait analysis:\nopenness: creativity, curiosity, open-mindedness, artistic_interests, emotional_awareness\nconscientiousness: organization, responsibility, self_discipline, achievement_striving, cautiousness\nextraversion: sociability, assertiveness, energy_level, excitement_seeking, cheerfulness\nagreeableness: trust, cooperation, altruism, modesty, empathy\nneuroticism: anxiety, emotional_stability, self_consciousness, stress_sensitivity, moodiness\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity (e.g., \"Openness_In_Book_Discussion\" for a trait manifestation, \"Garden_Confrontation\" for a scene)\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [character,personality_trait,scene,interaction,motivation]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description including:\n  * For traits: Which Big Five dimension, how it manifests\n  * For behaviors: Specific actions/responses showing the trait\n  * For scenes: Context and situation details\n  * For triggers: What caused the trait expression\n  * For development: How the trait has changed\nAdditionally, ensure that the following personality trait entities are ALWAYS included:\n\na) The five core Big Five traits as primary personality nodes:\n   \"Openness\", \"Conscientiousness\", \"Extraversion\", \"Agreeableness\", \"Neuroticism\"\n\nb) For each Big Five dimension, extract at least 2-3 specific facet traits from openness: creativity, curiosity, open-mindedness, artistic_interests, emotional_awareness\nconscientiousness: organization, responsibility, self_discipline, achievement_striving, cautiousness\nextraversion: sociability, assertiveness, energy_level, excitement_seeking, cheerfulness\nagreeableness: trust, cooperation, altruism, modesty, empathy\nneuroticism: anxiety, emotional_stability, self_consciousness, stress_sensitivity, moodiness that are most evident in Antigone's behavior.\n\nc) Each trait entity description must include:\n   - Clear definition of the trait as applied to Antigone\n   - Examples of how this trait manifests in their behavior\n   - Indication of the trait's strength (high, moderate, or low)\n   - Any notable changes or development in this trait throughout the narrative\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2.

gone? \n\nGUARD Well, this is it.-The corpse-some one hath just given it burial,\nand gone away,-after sprinkling thirsty dust on the flesh, with such\nother rites as piety enjoins. \n\nCREON What sayest thou? What living man hath dared this deed?\n\nGUARD I know not; no stroke of pickaxe was seen there, no earth thrown\nup by mattock; the ground was hard and dry, unbroken, without track\nof wheels; the doer was one who had left no trace. And when the first\nday-watchman showed it to us, sore wonder fell on all. The dead man\nwas veiled from us; not shut within a tomb, but lightly strewn with\ndust, as by the hand of one who shunned a curse. And no sign met the\neye as though any beast of prey or any dog had come nigh to him, or\ntorn him. \n\nThen evil words flew fast and loud among us, guard accusing guard;\nund it would e'en have come to blows at last, nor was there any to\nhinder. Every man was the culprit, and no one was convicted, but all\ndisclaimed knowledge of the deed. And we were ready to take red-hot\niron in our hands;-to walk through fire;-to make oath by the gods\nthat we had not done the deed,-that we were not privy to the planning\nor the doing. \n\nAt last, when all our searching was fruitless, one spake, who made\nus all bend our faces on the earth in fear; for we saw not how we\ncould gainsay him, or escape mischance if we obeyed. His counsel was\nthat this deed must be reported to thee, and not hidden. And this\nseemed best; and the lot doomed my hapless self to win this prize.\nSo here I stand,-as unwelcome as unwilling, well I wot; for no man\ndelights in the bearer of bad news. \n\nLEADER O king, my thoughts have long been whispering, can this deed,\nperchance, be e'en the work of gods? \n\nCREON Cease, ere thy words fill me utterly with wrath, lest thou\nbe found at once an old man and foolish. For thou sayest what is not\nto be borne, in saying that the gods have care for this corpse. Was\nit for high reward of trusty service that they sought to hide his\nnakedness, who came to burn their pillared shrines and sacred treasures,\nto burn their land, and scatter its laws to the winds? Or dost thou\nbehold the gods honouring the wicked? It cannot be. No! From the first\nthere were certain in the town that muttered against me, chafing at\nthis edict, wagging their heads in secret; and kept not their necks\nduly under the yoke, like men contented with my sway. \n\n'Tis by them, well I know, that these have been beguiled and bribed\nto do this deed. Nothing so evil as money ever grew to be current\namong men. This lays cities low, this drives men from their homes,\nthis trains and warps honest souls till they set themselves to works\nof shame; this still teaches folk to practise villainies, and to know\nevery godless deed. \n\nBut all the men who wrought this thing for hire have made it sure\nthat, soon or late, they shall pay the price. Now, as Zeus still hath\nmy reverence, know this-I tell it thee on my oath:-If ye find not\nthe very author of this burial, and produce him before mine eyes,\ndeath alone shall not be enough for you, till first, hung up alive,\nye have revealed this outrage,-that henceforth ye may thieve with\nbetter knowledge whence lucre should be won, and learn that it is\nnot well to love gain from every source. For thou wilt find that ill-gotten\npelf brings more men to ruin than to weal. \n\nGUARD May I speak? Or shall I just turn and go? \n\nCREON Knowest thou not that even now thy voice offends?\n\nGUARD Is thy smart in the ears, or in the soul? \n\nCREON And why wouldst thou define the seat of my pain? \n\nGUARD The doer vexes thy mind, but I, thine ears. \n\nCREON Ah, thou art a born babbler, 'tis well seen. \n\nGUARD May be, but never the doer of this deed. \n\nCREON Yea, and more,-the seller of thy life for silver.\n\nGUARD Alas! 'Tis sad, truly, that he who judges should misjudge.\n\nCREON Let thy fancy play with 'judgment' as it will;-but, if ye show\nme not the doers of these things, ye shall avow that dastardly gains\nwork sorrows.  (CREON goes into the palace.)  \n\nGUARD Well, may he be found! so 'twere best. But, be he caught or\nbe he not-fortune must settle that-truly thou wilt not see me here\nagain.

A description of how each trait is exhibited (detailing how the character's behaviors and dialogue reflect the trait).\n2. Supporting excerpts from the novel that illustrate the trait.\n3. A causal relationship explanation that describes the events or interactions triggering these trait expressions (e.g., character interactions, plot twists).\n4. Create a comprehensive personality profile centered around the Big Five dimensions that forms the backbone of the knowledge graph.\nUse English as output language.\n\nNote: Refer to the following Big Five personality dimensions and their associated facets for trait analysis:\nopenness: creativity, curiosity, open-mindedness, artistic_interests, emotional_awareness\nconscientiousness: organization, responsibility, self_discipline, achievement_striving, cautiousness\nextraversion: sociability, assertiveness, energy_level, excitement_seeking, cheerfulness\nagreeableness: trust, cooperation, altruism, modesty, empathy\nneuroticism: anxiety, emotional_stability, self_consciousness, stress_sensitivity, moodiness\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity (e.g., \"Openness_In_Book_Discussion\" for a trait manifestation, \"Garden_Confrontation\" for a scene)\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [character,personality_trait,scene,interaction,motivation]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description including:\n  * For traits: Which Big Five dimension, how it manifests\n  * For behaviors: Specific actions/responses showing the trait\n  * For scenes: Context and situation details\n  * For triggers: What caused the trait expression\n  * For development: How the trait has changed\nAdditionally, ensure that the following personality trait entities are ALWAYS included:\n\na) The five core Big Five traits as primary personality nodes:\n   \"Openness\", \"Conscientiousness\", \"Extraversion\", \"Agreeableness\", \"Neuroticism\"\n\nb) For each Big Five dimension, extract at least 2-3 specific facet traits from openness: creativity, curiosity, open-mindedness, artistic_interests, emotional_awareness\nconscientiousness: organization, responsibility, self_discipline, achievement_striving, cautiousness\nextraversion: sociability, assertiveness, energy_level, excitement_seeking, cheerfulness\nagreeableness: trust, cooperation, altruism, modesty, empathy\nneuroticism: anxiety, emotional_stability, self_consciousness, stress_sensitivity, moodiness that are most evident in Antigone's behavior.\n\nc) Each trait entity description must include:\n   - Clear definition of the trait as applied to Antigone\n   - Examples of how this trait manifests in their behavior\n   - Indication of the trait's strength (high, moderate, or low)\n   - Any notable changes or development in this trait throughout the narrative\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs that are clearly related to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity (e.g., a trait)\n- target_entity: name of the target entity (e.g., a behavior or scene)\n- relationship_description: How these entities connect in showing Antigone's personality\n- relationship_strength: Score from 1-10 showing how strongly this relationship demonstrates the trait\n- relationship_keywords: Key themes about this personality trait \n\nEnsure the following relationship types are represented:\na) Antigone to each Big Five trait (e.g., \"Antigone to Openness\")\nb) Each Big Five trait to its relevant facets (e.g., \"Openness to Creativity\")\nc) Each Big Five trait to supporting scenes (e.g., \"Extraversion to Party_Scene\")\nd) Each Big Five trait to relevant motivations (e.g., \"Conscientiousness to Achievement_Drive\")\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_keywords><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.Graph Structure Requirement:\nEnsure that the generated knowledge graph is centered on Antigone with the Big Five personality traits as primary nodes:\n    a) Every core Big Five personality trait (\"Openness\", \"Conscientiousness\", \"Extraversion\", \"Agreeableness\", \"Neuroticism\") MUST be directly connected to the Antigone node through strong relationship edges.\n   \n    b) All scene, interaction, and motivation entities MUST be connected to at least one Big Five personality trait node, showing how they demonstrate or relate to that specific trait.\n   \n    c) For each Big Five trait, identify at least 2-3 specific facets (from the provided dimensions list) that are most prominently displayed by Antigone and connect them as sub-traits.\n   \n    d) Prioritize creating meaningful relationships that illustrate how specific scenes, interactions, or motivations demonstrate or reinforce particular personality traits.\n\n4. Identify high-level key words that summarize the main personality traits and their development shown in the text.\nFormat as (\"content_keywords\"<|><high_level_keywords>)\n\n5.

when, by the will of\nDionysus, he was pent in a rocky prison. There the fierce exuberance\nof his madness slowly passed away. That man learned to know the god,\nwhom in his frenzy he had provoked with mockeries; for he had sought\nto quell the god-possessed women, and the Bacchanalian fire; and he\nangered the Muses that love the flute. \n\n(strophe 2)\n\nAnd by the waters of the Dark Rocks, the waters of the twofold sea,\nare the shores of Bosporus, and Thracian Salmydessus; where Ares,\nneighbour to the city, saw the accurst, blinding wound dealt to the\ntwo sons of Phineus by his fierce wife,-the wound that brought darkness\nto those vengeance-craving orbs, smitten with her bloody hands, smitten\nwith her shuttle for a dagger. \n\n(antistrophe 2)\n\nPining in their misery, they bewailed their cruel doom, those sons\nof a mother hapless in her marriage; but she traced her descent from\nthe ancient line of the Erechtheidae; and in far-distant caves she\nwas nursed amid her father's storms, that child of Boreas, swift as\na steed over the steep hills, a daughter of gods; yet upon her also\nthe gray Fates bore hard, my daughter.

this special conference of\nelders, summoned by his general mandate?  (Enter CREON, from the central\ndoors of the palace, in the garb of king, with two attendants.)\n\nCREON Sirs, the vessel of our State, after being tossed on wild waves,\nhath once more been safely steadied by the gods: and ye, out of all\nthe folk, have been called apart by my summons, because I knew, first\nof all, how true and constant was your reverence for the royal power\nof Laius; how, again, when Oedipus was ruler of our land, and when\nhe had perished, your steadfast loyalty still upheld their children.\nSince, then, his sons have fallen in one day by a twofold doom,-each\nsmitten by the other, each stained with a brother's blood,-I now possess\nthe throne and all its powers, by nearness of kinship to the dead.\n\nNo man can be fully known, in soul and spirit and mind, until he hath\nbeen seen versed in rule and law-giving. For if any, being supreme\nguide of the State, cleaves not to the best counsels, but, through\nsome fear, keeps his lips locked, I hold, and have ever held, him\nmost base; and if any makes a friend of more account than his fatherland,\nthat man hath no place in my regard. For I-be Zeus my witness, who\nsees all things always-would not be silent if I saw ruin, instead\nof safety, coming to the citizens; nor would I ever deem the country's\nfoe a friend to myself; remembering this, that our country is the\nship that bears us safe, and that only while she prospers in our voyage\ncan we make true friends. \n\nSuch are the rules by which I guard this city's greatness. And in\naccord with them is the edict which I have now published to the folk\ntouching the sons of Oedipus;-that Eteocles, who hath fallen fighting\nfor our city, in all renown of arms, shall be entombed, and crowned\nwith every rite that follows the noblest dead to their rest. But for\nhis brother, Polyneices,-who came back from exile, and sought to consume\nutterly with fire the city of his fathers and the shrines of his fathers'\ngods,-sought to taste of kindred blood, and to lead the remnant into\nslavery;-touching this man, it hath been proclaimed to our people\nthat none shall grace him with sepulture or lament, but leave him\nunburied, a corpse for birds and dogs to eat, a ghastly sight of shame.\n\nSuch the spirit of my dealing; and never, by deed of mine, shall the\nwicked stand in honour before the just; but whoso hath good will to\nThebes, he shall be honoured of me, in his life and in his death.\n\nLEADER OF THE CHORUS Such is thy pleasure, Creon, son of Menoeceus,\ntouching this city's foe, and its friend; and thou hast power, I ween,\nto take what order thou wilt, both for the dead, and for all us who\nlive. \n\nCREON See, then, that ye be guardians of the mandate. \n\nLEADER Lay the burden of this task on some younger man.\n\nCREON Nay, watchers of the corpse have been found. \n\nLEADER What, then, is this further charge that thou wouldst give?\n\nCREON That ye side not with the breakers of these commands.\n\nLEADER No man is so foolish that he is enamoured of death.\n\nCREON In sooth, that is the meed; yet lucre hath oft ruined men through\ntheir hopes.  (A GUARD enters from the spectators' left.)\n\nGUARD My liege, I will not say that I come breathless from speed,\nor that have plied a nimble foot; for often did my thoughts make me\npause, and wheel round in my path, to return. My mind was holding\nlarge discourse with me; 'Fool, why goest thou to thy certain doom?'\n'Wretch, tarrying again? And if Creon hears this from another, must\nnot thou smart for it?' So debating, I went on my way with lagging\nsteps, and thus a short road was made long. At last, however, it carried\nthe day that I should come hither-to thee; and, though my tale be\nnought, yet will I tell it; for I come with a good grip on one hope,-that\nI can suffer nothing but what is my fate. \n\nCREON And what is it that disquiets thee thus? \n\nGUARD I wish to tell thee first about myself-I did not do the deed-I\ndid not see the doer-it were not right that I should come to any harm.\n\nCREON Thou hast a shrewd eye for thy mark; well dost thou fence thyself\nround against the blame; clearly thou hast some strange thing to tell.\n\nGUARD Aye, truly; dread news makes one pause long. \n\nCREON Then tell it, wilt thou, and so get thee gone? \n\nGUARD Well, this is it.-The corpse-some one hath just given it burial,\nand gone away,-after sprinkling thirsty dust on the flesh, with such\nother rites as piety enjoins. \n\nCREON What sayest thou? What living man hath dared this deed?\n\nGUARD I know\n######################\nOutput:\n"

A description of how each trait is exhibited (detailing how the character's behaviors and dialogue reflect the trait).\n2. Supporting excerpts from the novel that illustrate the trait.\n3. A causal relationship explanation that describes the events or interactions triggering these trait expressions (e.g., character interactions, plot twists).\n4. Create a comprehensive personality profile centered around the Big Five dimensions that forms the backbone of the knowledge graph.\nUse English as output language.\n\nNote: Refer to the following Big Five personality dimensions and their associated facets for trait analysis:\nopenness: creativity, curiosity, open-mindedness, artistic_interests, emotional_awareness\nconscientiousness: organization, responsibility, self_discipline, achievement_striving, cautiousness\nextraversion: sociability, assertiveness, energy_level, excitement_seeking, cheerfulness\nagreeableness: trust, cooperation, altruism, modesty, empathy\nneuroticism: anxiety, emotional_stability, self_consciousness, stress_sensitivity, moodiness\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity (e.g., \"Openness_In_Book_Discussion\" for a trait manifestation, \"Garden_Confrontation\" for a scene)\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [character,personality_trait,scene,interaction,motivation]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description including:\n  * For traits: Which Big Five dimension, how it manifests\n  * For behaviors: Specific actions/responses showing the trait\n  * For scenes: Context and situation details\n  * For triggers: What caused the trait expression\n  * For development: How the trait has changed\nAdditionally, ensure that the following personality trait entities are ALWAYS included:\n\na) The five core Big Five traits as primary personality nodes:\n   \"Openness\", \"Conscientiousness\", \"Extraversion\", \"Agreeableness\", \"Neuroticism\"\n\nb) For each Big Five dimension, extract at least 2-3 specific facet traits from openness: creativity, curiosity, open-mindedness, artistic_interests, emotional_awareness\nconscientiousness: organization, responsibility, self_discipline, achievement_striving, cautiousness\nextraversion: sociability, assertiveness, energy_level, excitement_seeking, cheerfulness\nagreeableness: trust, cooperation, altruism, modesty, empathy\nneuroticism: anxiety, emotional_stability, self_consciousness, stress_sensitivity, moodiness that are most evident in Antigone's behavior.\n\nc) Each trait entity description must include:\n   - Clear definition of the trait as applied to Antigone\n   - Examples of how this trait manifests in their behavior\n   - Indication of the trait's strength (high, moderate, or low)\n   - Any notable changes or development in this trait throughout the narrative\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2.

A description of how each trait is exhibited (detailing how the character's behaviors and dialogue reflect the trait).\n2. Supporting excerpts from the novel that illustrate the trait.\n3. A causal relationship explanation that describes the events or interactions triggering these trait expressions (e.g., character interactions, plot twists).\n4. Create a comprehensive personality profile centered around the Big Five dimensions that forms the backbone of the knowledge graph.\nUse English as output language.\n\nNote: Refer to the following Big Five personality dimensions and their associated facets for trait analysis:\nopenness: creativity, curiosity, open-mindedness, artistic_interests, emotional_awareness\nconscientiousness: organization, responsibility, self_discipline, achievement_striving, cautiousness\nextraversion: sociability, assertiveness, energy_level, excitement_seeking, cheerfulness\nagreeableness: trust, cooperation, altruism, modesty, empathy\nneuroticism: anxiety, emotional_stability, self_consciousness, stress_sensitivity, moodiness\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity (e.g., \"Openness_In_Book_Discussion\" for a trait manifestation, \"Garden_Confrontation\" for a scene)\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [character,personality_trait,scene,interaction,motivation]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description including:\n  * For traits: Which Big Five dimension, how it manifests\n  * For behaviors: Specific actions/responses showing the trait\n  * For scenes: Context and situation details\n  * For triggers: What caused the trait expression\n  * For development: How the trait has changed\nAdditionally, ensure that the following personality trait entities are ALWAYS included:\n\na) The five core Big Five traits as primary personality nodes:\n   \"Openness\", \"Conscientiousness\", \"Extraversion\", \"Agreeableness\", \"Neuroticism\"\n\nb) For each Big Five dimension, extract at least 2-3 specific facet traits from openness: creativity, curiosity, open-mindedness, artistic_interests, emotional_awareness\nconscientiousness: organization, responsibility, self_discipline, achievement_striving, cautiousness\nextraversion: sociability, assertiveness, energy_level, excitement_seeking, cheerfulness\nagreeableness: trust, cooperation, altruism, modesty, empathy\nneuroticism: anxiety, emotional_stability, self_consciousness, stress_sensitivity, moodiness that are most evident in Antigone's behavior.\n\nc) Each trait entity description must include:\n   - Clear definition of the trait as applied to Antigone\n   - Examples of how this trait manifests in their behavior\n   - Indication of the trait's strength (high, moderate, or low)\n   - Any notable changes or development in this trait throughout the narrative\n\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2.

For when a house\nhath once been shaken from heaven, there the curse fails nevermore,\npassing from life to life of the race; even as, when the surge is\ndriven over the darkness of the deep by the fierce breath of Thracian\nsea-winds, it rolls up the black sand from the depths, and there is\nsullen roar from wind-vexed headlands that front the blows of the\nstorm. \n\n(antistrophe 1)\n\nI see that from olden time the sorrows in the house of the Labdacidae\nare heaped upon the sorrows of the dead; and generation is not freed\nby generation, but some god strikes them down, and the race hath no\ndeliverance. \n\nFor now that hope of which the light had been spread above the last\nroot of the house of Oedipus-that hope, in turn, is brought low--by\nthe blood-stained dust due to the gods infernal, and by folly in speech,\nand frenzy at the heart. \n\n(strophe 2)\n\nThy power, O Zeus, what human trespass can limit? That power which\nneither Sleep, the all-ensnaring, nor the untiring months of the gods\ncan master; but thou, a ruler to whom time brings not old age, dwellest\nin the dazzling splendour of Olympus. \n\nAnd through the future, near and far, as through the past, shall this\nlaw hold good: Nothing that is vast enters into the life of mortals\nwithout a curse. \n\n(antistrophe 2)\n\nFor that hope whose wanderings are so wide is to many men a comfort,\nbut to many a false lure of giddy desires; and the disappointment\ncomes on one who knoweth nought till he burn his foot against the\nhot fire. \n\nFor with wisdom hath some one given forth the famous saying, that\nevil seems good, soon or late, to him whose mind the god draws to\nmischief; and but for the briefest space doth he fare free of woe.\n\nLEADER OF THE CHORUS But lo, Haemon, the last of thy sons;-Comes\nhe grieving for the doom of his promised bride, Antigone, and bitter\nfor the baffled hope of his marriage?  (Enter HAEMON)  \n\nCREON We shall know soon, better than seers could tell us.-My son,\nhearing the fixed doom of thy betrothed, art thou come in rage against\nthy father? Or have I thy good will, act how I may? \n\nHAEMON Father, I am thine; and thou, in thy wisdom, tracest for me\nrules which I shall follow. No marriage shall be deemed by me a greater\ngain than thy good guidance. \n\nCREON Yea, this, my son, should be thy heart's fixed law,-in all\nthings to obey thy father's will. 'Tis for this that men pray to see\ndutiful children grow up around them in their homes,-that such may\nrequite their father's foe with evil, and honour, as their father\ndoth, his friend. But he who begets unprofitable children-what shall\nwe say that he hath sown, but troubles for himself, and much triumph\nfor his foes? Then do not thou, my son, at pleasure's beck, dethrone\nthy reason for a woman's sake; knowing that this is a joy that soon\ngrows cold in clasping arms,-an evil woman to share thy bed and thy\nhome. For what wound could strike deeper than a false friend? Nay,\nwith loathing, and as if she were thine enemy, let this girl go to\nfind a husband in the house of Hades. For since I have taken her,\nalone of all the city, in open disobedience, I will not make myself\na liar to my people-I will slay her. \n\nSo let her appeal as she will to the majesty of kindred blood. If\nI am to nurture mine own kindred in naughtiness, needs must I bear\nwith it in aliens. He who does his duty in his own household will\nbe found righteous in the State also. But if any one transgresses,\nand does violence to the laws, or thinks to dictate to his rulers,\nsuch an one can win no praise from me. No, whomsoever the city may\nappoint, that man must be obeyed, in little things and great, in just\nthings and unjust; and I should feel sure that one who thus obeys\nwould be a good ruler no less than a good subject, and in the storm\nof spears would stand his ground where he was set, loyal and dauntless\nat his comrade's side. \n\nBut disobedience is the worst of evils. This it is that ruins cities;\nthis makes homes desolate; by this, the ranks of allies are broken\ninto head-long rout; but, of the lives whose course is fair, the greater\npart owes safety to obedience. Therefore we must support the cause\nof order, and in no wise suffer a woman to worst us. Better to fall\nfrom power, if we must, by a man's hand; then we should not be called\nweaker than a woman. \n\nLEADER To us, unless our years have stolen our wit, thou seemest\nto say wisely what thou sayest. \n\nHAEMON Father, the gods implant reason in men, the highest of all\nthings that we call our own.

Knowest thou aught?

'Tis plain that thou art brooding on some dark\ntidings. \n\nANTIGONE What, hath not Creon destined our brothers, the one to honoured\nburial, the other to unburied shame? Eteocles, they say, with due\nobservance of right and custom, he hath laid in the earth, for his\nhonour among the dead below. But the hapless corpse of Polyneices-as\nrumour saith, it hath been published to the town that none shall entomb\nhim or mourn, but leave unwept, unsepulchred, a welcome store for\nthe birds, as they espy him, to feast on at will. \n\nSuch, 'tis said, is the edict that the good Creon hath set forth for\nthee and for me,-yes, for me,-and is coming hither to proclaim it\nclearly to those who know it not; nor counts the matter light, but,\nwhoso disobeys in aught, his doom is death by stoning before all the\nfolk. Thou knowest it now; and thou wilt soon show whether thou art\nnobly bred, or the base daughter of a noble line. \n\nISMENE Poor sister,-and if things stand thus, what could I help to\ndo or undo? \n\nANTIGONE Consider if thou wilt share the toil and the deed.\n\nISMENE In what venture? What can be thy meaning? \n\nANTIGONE Wilt thou aid this hand to lift the dead? \n\nISMENE Thou wouldst bury him,-when 'tis forbidden to Thebes?\n\nANTIGONE I will do my part,-and thine, if thou wilt not,-to a brother.\nFalse to him will I never be found. \n\nISMENE Ah, over-bold! when Creon hath forbidden? \n\nANTIGONE Nay, he hath no right to keep me from mine own.\n\nISMENE Ah me! think, sister, how our father perished, amid hate and\nscorn, when sins bared by his own search had moved him to strike both\neyes with self-blinding hand; then the mother wife, two names in one,\nwith twisted noose did despite unto her life; and last, our two brothers\nin one day,-each shedding, hapless one, a kinsman's blood,-wrought\nout with mutual hands their common doom. And now we in turn-we two\nleft all alone think how we shall perish, more miserably than all\nthe rest, if, in defiance of the law, we brave a king's decree or\nhis powers. Nay, we must remember, first, that we were born women,\nas who should not strive with men; next, that we are ruled of the\nstronger, so that we must obey in these things, and in things yet\nsorer. I, therefore, asking the Spirits Infernal to pardon, seeing\nthat force is put on me herein, will hearken to our rulers. for 'tis\nwitless to be over busy. \n\nANTIGONE I will not urge thee,-no nor, if thou yet shouldst have\nthe mind, wouldst thou be welcome as a worker with me. Nay, be what\nthou wilt; but I will bury him: well for me to die in doing that.\nI shall rest, a loved one with him whom I have loved, sinless in my\ncrime; for I owe a longer allegiance to the dead than to the living:\nin that world I shall abide for ever.

At least, it is my natural office\nto watch, on thy behalf, all that men say, or do, or find to blame.\nFor the dread of thy frown forbids the citizen to speak such words\nas would offend thine ear; but can hear these murmurs in the dark,\nthese moanings of the city for this maiden; 'no woman,' they say,\n'ever merited her doom less,-none ever was to die so shamefully for\ndeeds so glorious as hers; who, when her own brother had fallen in\nbloody strife, would not leave him unburied, to be devoured by carrion\ndogs, or by any bird:-deserves not she the meed of golden honour?'\n\nSuch is the darkling rumour that spreads in secret. For me, my father,\nno treasure is so precious as thy welfare. What, indeed, is a nobler\nornament for children than a prospering sire's fair fame, or for sire\nthan son's? Wear not, then, one mood only in thyself; think not that\nthy word, and thine alone, must be right. For if any man thinks that\nhe alone is wise,-that in speech, or in mind, he hath no peer,-such\na soul, when laid open, is ever found empty. \n\nNo, though a man be wise, 'tis no shame for him to learn many things,\nand to bend in season. Seest thou, beside the wintry torrent's course,\nhow the trees that yield to it save every twig, while the stiff-necked\nperish root and branch? And even thus he who keeps the sheet of his\nsail taut, and never slackens it, upsets his boat, and finishes his\nvoyage with keel uppermost. \n\nNay, forego thy wrath; permit thyself to change. For if I, a younger\nman, may offer my thought, it were far best, I ween, that men should\nbe all-wise by nature; but, otherwise-and oft the scale inclines not\nso-'tis good also to learn from those who speak aright. \n\nLEADER Sire, 'tis meet that thou shouldest profit by his words, if\nhe speaks aught in season, and thou, Haemon, by thy father's; for\non both parts there hath been wise speech. \n\nCREON Men of my age are we indeed to be schooled, then, by men of\nhis? \n\nHAEMON In nothing that is not right; but if I am young, thou shouldest\nlook to my merits, not to my years. \n\nCREON Is it a merit to honour the unruly? \n\nHAEMON I could wish no one to show respect for evil-doers.\n\nCREON Then is not she tainted with that malady? \n\nHAEMON Our Theban folk, with one voice, denies it. \n\nCREON Shall Thebes prescribe to me how I must rule? \n\nHAEMON See, there thou hast spoken like a youth indeed.\n\nCREON Am I to rule this land by other judgment than mine own?\n\nHAEMON That is no city which belongs to one man. \n\nCREON Is not the city held to be the ruler's? \n\nHAEMON Thou wouldst make a good monarch of a desert. \n\nCREON This boy, it seems, is the woman's champion. \n\nHAEMON If thou art a woman; indeed, my care is for thee.\n\nCREON Shameless, at open feud with thy father! \n\nHAEMON Nay, I see thee offending against justice. \n\nCREON Do I offend, when I respect mine own prerogatives?\n\nHAEMON Thou dost not respect them, when thou tramplest on the gods'\nhonours, \n\nCREON O dastard nature, yielding place to woman! \n\nHAEMON Thou wilt never find me yield to baseness. \n\nCREON All thy words, at least, plead for that girl. \n\nHAEMON And for thee, and for me, and for the gods below.\n\nCREON Thou canst never marry her, on this side the grave.\n\nHAEMON Then she must die, and in death destroy another.\n\nCREON How! doth thy boldness run to open threats? \n\nHAEMON What threat is it, to combat vain resolves? \n\nCREON Thou shalt rue thy witless teaching of wisdom. \n\nHAEMON Wert thou not my father, I would have called thee unwise.\n\nCREON Thou woman's slave, use not wheedling speech with me.\n\nHAEMON Thou wouldest speak, and then hear no reply? \n\nCREON Sayest thou so? Now, by the heaven above us-be sure of it-thou\nshalt smart for taunting me in this opprobrious strain. Bring forth\nthat hated thing, that she may die forthwith in his presence-before\nhis eyes-at her bridegroom's side! \n\nHAEMON No, not at my side-never think it-shall she perish; nor shalt\nthou ever set eyes more upon my face:-rave, then, with such friends\nas can endure thee.

Am I going on the wofullest\nway that ever I went? My son's voice greets me.-Go, my servants,-haste\nye nearer, and when ye have reached the tomb, pass through the gap,\nwhere the stones have been wrenched away, to the cell's very mouth,-and\nlook. and see if 'tis Haemon's voice that I know, or if mine ear is\ncheated by the gods.' \n\nThis search, at our despairing master's word, we went to make; and\nin the furthest part of the tomb we descried her hanging by the neck,\nslung by a thread-wrought halter of fine linen: while he was embracing\nher with arms thrown around her waist, bewailing the loss of his bride\nwho is with the dead, and his father's deeds, and his own ill-starred\nlove. \n\nBut his father, when he saw him, cried aloud with a dread cry and\nwent in, and called to him with a voice of wailing:-'Unhappy, what\ndeed hast thou done! What thought hath come to thee? What manner of\nmischance hath marred thy reason? Come forth, my child! I pray thee-I\nimplore!' But the boy glared at him with fierce eyes, spat in his\nface, and, without a word of answer, drew his cross-hilted sword:-as\nhis father rushed forth in flight, he missed his aim;-then, hapless\none, wroth with himself, he straightway leaned with all his weight\nagainst his sword, and drove it, half its length, into his side; and,\nwhile sense lingered, he clasped the maiden to his faint embrace,\nand, as he gasped, sent forth on her pale cheek the swift stream of\nthe oozing blood. \n\nCorpse enfolding corpse he lies; he hath won his nuptial rites, poor\nyouth, not here, yet in the halls of Death; and he hath witnessed\nto mankind that, of all curses which cleave to man, ill counsel is\nthe sovereign curse.  (EURYDICE retires into the house.)\n\nLEADER What wouldst thou augur from this? The lady hath turned back,\nand is gone, without a word, good or evil. \n\nMESSENGER I, too, am startled; yet I nourish the hope that, at these\nsore tidings of her son, she cannot deign to give her sorrow public\nvent, but in the privacy of the house will set her handmaids to mourn\nthe household grief. For she is not untaught of discretion, that she\nshould err. \n\nLEADER I know not; but to me, at least, a strained silence seems\nto portend peril, no less than vain abundance of lament.\n\nMESSENGER Well, I will enter the house, and learn whether indeed\nshe is not hiding some repressed purpose in the depths of a passionate\nheart. Yea, thou sayest well: excess of silence, too, may have a perilous\nmeaning.  (The MESSENGER goes into the palace. Enter CREON, on the\nspectators' left, with attendants, carrying the shrouded body of HAEMON\non bier. The following lines between CREON and the CHORUS are chanted\nresponsively.)  \n\nCHORUS Lo, yonder the king himself draws near, bearing that which\ntells too clear a tale,-the work of no stranger's madness,-if we may\nsay it,-but of his own misdeeds. \n\nCREON (strophe 1)\n\nWoe for the sins of a darkened soul, stubborn sins, fraught with\ndeath! Ah, ye behold us, the sire who hath slain, the son who hath\nperished! Woe is me, for the wretched blindness of my counsels! Alas,\nmy son, thou hast died in thy youth, by a timeless doom, woe is me!-thy\nspirit hath fled,-not by thy folly, but by mine own! \n\nCHORUS (strophe 2)\n\nAh me, how all too late thou seemest to see the right! \nCREON Ah me, I have learned the bitter lesson! But then, methinks,\noh then, some god smote me from above with crushing weight, and hurled\nme into ways of cruelty, woe is me,-overthrowing and trampling on\nmy joy! Woe, woe, for the troublous toils of men!  (Enter MESSENGER\nfrom the house.)  \n\nMESSENGER Sire, thou hast come, methinks, as one whose hands are\nnot empty, but who hath store laid up besides; thou bearest yonder\nburden with thee-and thou art soon to look upon the woes within thy\nhouse. \n\nCREON And what worse ill is yet to follow upon ills? \n\nMESSENGER Thy queen hath died, true mother of yon corpse-ah, hapless\nlady by blows newly dealt. \n\nCREON (antistrophe 1)\n\nOh Hades, all-receiving whom no sacrifice can appease! Hast thou,\nthen, no mercy for me? O thou herald of evil, bitter tidings, what\nword dost thou utter? Alas, I was already as dead, and thou hast smitten\nme anew! What sayest thou, my son? What is this new message that thou\nbringest-woe, woe is me!-Of a wife's doom-of slaughter headed on slaughter?\n\nCHORUS Thou canst behold: 'tis no longer hidden within.\n######################\nOutput:\n"

Saved, even now, beyond hope and thought, I owe the gods great\nthanks.  (The GUARD goes out on the spectators' left.)  \n\nCHORUS  (singing, strophe 1)\n\nWonders are many, and none is more wonderful than man; the power\nthat crosses the white sea, driven by the stormy south-wind, making\na path under surges that threaten to engulf him; and Earth, the eldest\nof the gods, the immortal, the unwearied, doth he wear, turning the\nsoil with the offspring of horses, as the ploughs go to and fro from\nyear to year. \n\n(antistrophe 1)\n\nAnd the light-hearted race of birds, and the tribes of savage beasts,\nand the sea-brood of the deep, he snares in the meshes of his woven\ntoils, he leads captive, man excellent in wit. And he masters by his\narts the beast whose lair is in the wilds, who roams the hills; he\ntames the horse of shaggy mane, he puts the yoke upon its neck, he\ntames the tireless mountain bull. \n\n(strophe 2)\n\nAnd speech, and wind-swift thought, and all the moods that mould\na state, hath he taught himself; and how to flee the arrows of the\nfrost, when 'tis hard lodging under the clear sky, and the arrows\nof the rushing rain; yea, he hath resource for all; without resource\nhe meets nothing that must come: only against Death shall he call\nfor aid in vain; but from baffling maladies he hath devised escapes.\n\n(antistrophe 2)\n\nCunning beyond fancy's dream is the fertile skill which brings him,\nnow to evil, now to good. When he honours the laws of the land, and\nthat justice which he hath sworn by the gods to uphold, proudly stands\nhis city: no city hath he who, for his rashness, dwells with sin.\nNever may he share my hearth, never think my thoughts, who doth these\nthings!  (Enter the GUARD on the spectators' left, leading in ANTIGONE.)\n\nLEADER OF THE CHORUS What portent from the gods is this?-my soul\nis amazed. I know her-how can I deny that yon maiden is Antigone?\n\nO hapless, and child of hapless sire,-Of Oedipus! What means this?\nThou brought a prisoner?-thou, disloyal to the king's laws, and taken\nin folly? \n\nGUARD Here she is, the doer of the deed:-caught this girl burying\nhim:-but where is Creon?  (CREON enters hurriedly from the palace.)\n\nLEADER Lo, he comes forth again from the house, at our need.\n\nCREON What is it? What hath chanced, that makes my coming timely?\n\nGUARD O king, against nothing should men pledge their word; for the\nafter-thought belies the first intent. I could have vowed that I should\nnot soon be here again,-scared by thy threats, with which I had just\nbeen lashed: but,-since the joy that surprises and transcends our\nhopes is like in fulness to no other pleasure,-I have come, though\n'tis in breach of my sworn oath, bringing this maid; who was taken\nshowing grace to the dead. This time there was no casting of lots;\nno, this luck hath fallen to me, and to none else. And now, sire,\ntake her thyself, question her, examine her, as thou wilt; but I have\na right to free and final quittance of this trouble. \n\nCREON And thy prisoner here-how and whence hast thou taken her?\n\nGUARD She was burying the man; thou knowest all. \n\nCREON Dost thou mean what thou sayest? Dost thou speak aright?\n\nGUARD I saw her burying the corpse that thou hadst forbidden to bury.\nIs that plain and clear? \n\nCREON And how was she seen? how taken in the act? \n\nGUARD It befell on this wise. When we had come to the place,-with\nthose dread menaces of thine upon us,-we swept away all the dust that\ncovered the corpse, and bared the dank body well; and then sat us\ndown on the brow of the hill, to windward, heedful that the smell\nfrom him should not strike us; every man was wide awake, and kept\nhis neighbour alert with torrents of threats, if anyone should be\ncareless of this task. \n\nSo went it, until the sun's bright orb stood in mid heaven, and the\nheat began to burn: and then suddenly a whirlwind lifted from the\nearth storm of dust, a trouble in the sky the plain, marring all the\nleafage of its woods; and the wide air was choked therewith: we closed\nour eyes, and bore the plague from the gods. \n\nAnd when, after a long while, this storm had passed, the maid was\nseen; and she cried aloud with the sharp cry of a bird in its bitterness,-even\nas when, within the empty nest, it sees the bed stripped of its nestlings.\nSo she also, when she saw the corpse bare, lifted up a voice of wailing,\nand called down curses on the doers of that deed. And straightway\nshe brought thirsty dust in her hands; and from a shapely ewer of\nbronze, held high, with thrice-poured drink-offering\n######################\nOutput:\n"

character,personality_trait,scene,interaction,motivation\nText: she cried aloud with the sharp cry of a bird in its bitterness,-even\nas when, within the empty nest, it sees the bed stripped of its nestlings.\nSo she also, when she saw the corpse bare, lifted up a voice of wailing,\nand called down curses on the doers of that deed. And straightway\nshe brought thirsty dust in her hands; and from a shapely ewer of\nbronze, held high, with thrice-poured drink-offering she crowned the\ndead. \n\nWe rushed forward when we saw it, and at once dosed upon our quarry,\nwho was in no wise dismayed. Then we taxed her with her past and present\ndoings; and she stood not on denial of aught,-at once to my joy and\nto my pain. To have escaped from ills one's self is a great joy; but\n'tis painful to bring friends to ill. Howbeit, all such things are\nof less account to me than mine own safety. \n\nCREON Thou-thou whose face is bent to earth-dost thou avow, or disavow,\nthis deed? \n\nANTIGONE I avow it; I make no denial. \n\nCREON  (to GUARD) Thou canst betake thee whither thou wilt, free\nand clear of a grave charge.  (Exit GUARD, To ANTIGONE)  Now, tell\nme thou-not in many words, but briefly-knewest thou that an edict\nhad forbidden this? \n\nANTIGONE I knew it: could I help it? It was public. \n\nCREON And thou didst indeed dare to transgress that law?\n\nANTIGONE Yes; for it was not Zeus that had published me that edict;\nnot such are the laws set among men by the justice who dwells with\nthe gods below; nor deemed I that thy decrees were of such force,\nthat a mortal could override the unwritten and unfailing statutes\nof heaven. For their life is not of to-day or yesterday, but from\nall time, and no man knows when they were first put forth.\n\nNot through dread of any human pride could I answer to the gods for\nbreaking these. Die I must,-I knew that well (how should I not?)-even\nwithout thy edicts. But if I am to die before my time, I count that\na gain: for when any one lives, as I do, compassed about with evils,\ncan such an one find aught but gain in death? \n\nSo for me to meet this doom is trifling grief; but if I had suffered\nmy mother's son to lie in death an unburied corpse, that would have\ngrieved me; for this, I am not grieved. And if my present deeds are\nfoolish in thy sight, it may be that a foolish judge arraigns my folly.\n\nLEADER OF THE CHORUS The maid shows herself passionate child of passionate\nsire, and knows not how to bend before troubles. \n\nCREON Yet I would have thee know that o'er-stubborn spirits are most\noften humbled; 'tis the stiffest iron, baked to hardness in the fire,\nthat thou shalt oftenest see snapped and shivered; and I have known\nhorses that show temper brought to order by a little curb; there is\nno room for pride when thou art thy neighbour's slave.-This girl was\nalready versed in insolence when she transgressed the laws that had\nbeen set forth; and, that done, lo, a second insult,-to vaunt of this,\nand exult in her deed. \n\nNow verily I am no man, she is the man, if this victory shall rest\nwith her, and bring no penalty. No! be she sister's child, or nearer\nto me in blood than any that worships Zeus at the altar of our house,-she\nand her kinsfolk shall not avoid a doom most dire; for indeed I charge\nthat other with a like share in the plotting of this burial.\n\nAnd summon her-for I saw her e'en now within,-raving, and not mistress\nof her wits. So oft, before the deed, the mind stands self-convicted\nin its treason, when folks are plotting mischief in the dark. But\nverily this, too, is hateful,-when one who hath been caught in wickednes\nthen seeks to make the crime a glory. \n\nANTIGONE Wouldst thou do more than take and slay me? \n\nCREON No more, indeed; having that, I have all. \n\nANTIGONE Why then dost thou delay? In thy discourse there is nought\nthat pleases me,-never may there be!-and so my words must needs be\nunpleasing to thee. And yet, for glory-whence could I have won a nobler,\nthan by giving burial to mine own brother? All here would own that\nthey thought it well, were not their lips sealed by fear. But royalty,\nblest in so much besides, hath the power to do and say what it will.\n\nCREON Thou differest from all these Thebans in that view.\n\nANTIGONE These also share it; but they curb their tongues for thee.\n\nCREON And art thou not ashamed to act apart from them? \n\nANTIGONE No; there is nothing shameful in piety to a brother.\n\nCREON Was it not a brother, too, that died in the opposite cause?\n\nANTIGONE Brother by the same mother and the same sire. \n\nCREON Why, then, dost thou render a grace that is impious in his\nsight? \n\nANTIGONE The dead man will not say that he so deems it.\n\nCREON\n######################\nOutput:\n"

This time there was no casting of lots;\\nno, this luck hath fallen to me, and to none else. And now, sire,\\ntake her thyself, question her, examine her, as thou wilt; but I have\\na right to free and final quittance of this trouble. \\n\\nCREON And thy prisoner here-how and whence hast thou taken her?\\n\\nGUARD She was burying the man; thou knowest all. \\n\\nCREON Dost thou mean what thou sayest?

character,personality_trait,scene,interaction,motivation\\nText: on, son of Menoeceus,\\nour new ruler by the new fortunes that the gods have given; what counsel\\nis he pondering, that he hath proposed this special conference of\\nelders, summoned by his general mandate?  (Enter CREON, from the central\\ndoors of the palace, in the garb of king, with two attendants.)\\n\\nCREON Sirs, the vessel of our State, after being tossed on wild waves,\\nhath once more been safely steadied by the gods: and ye, out of all\\nthe folk, have been called apart by my summons, because I knew, first\\nof all, how true and constant was your reverence for the royal power\\nof Laius; how, again, when Oedipus was ruler of our land, and when\\nhe had perished, your steadfast loyalty still upheld their children.\\nSince, then, his sons have fallen in one day by a twofold doom,-each\\nsmitten by the other, each stained with a brother's blood,-I now possess\\nthe throne and all its powers, by nearness of kinship to the dead.\\n\\nNo man can be fully known, in soul and spirit and mind, until he hath\\nbeen seen versed in rule and law-giving. For if any, being supreme\\nguide of the State, cleaves not to the best counsels, but, through\\nsome fear, keeps his lips locked, I hold, and have ever held, him\\nmost base; and if any makes a friend of more account than his fatherland,\\nthat man hath no place in my regard. For I-be Zeus my witness, who\\nsees all things always-would not be silent if I saw ruin, instead\\nof safety, coming to the citizens; nor would I ever deem the country's\\nfoe a friend to myself; remembering this, that our country is the\\nship that bears us safe, and that only while she prospers in our voyage\\ncan we make true friends. \\n\\nSuch are the rules by which I guard this city's greatness. And in\\naccord with them is the edict which I have now published to the folk\\ntouching the sons of Oedipus;-that Eteocles, who hath fallen fighting\\nfor our city, in all renown of arms, shall be entombed, and crowned\\nwith every rite that follows the noblest dead to their rest. But for\\nhis brother, Polyneices,-who came back from exile, and sought to consume\\nutterly with fire the city of his fathers and the shrines of his fathers'\\ngods,-sought to taste of kindred blood, and to lead the remnant into\\nslavery;-touching this man, it hath been proclaimed to our people\\nthat none shall grace him with sepulture or lament, but leave him\\nunburied, a corpse for birds and dogs to eat, a ghastly sight of shame.\\n\\nSuch the spirit of my dealing; and never, by deed of mine, shall the\\nwicked stand in honour before the just; but whoso hath good will to\\nThebes, he shall be honoured of me, in his life and in his death.\\n\\nLEADER OF THE CHORUS Such is thy pleasure, Creon, son of Menoeceus,\\ntouching this city's foe, and its friend; and thou hast power, I ween,\\nto take what order thou wilt, both for the dead, and for all us who\\nlive. \\n\\nCREON See, then, that ye be guardians of the mandate. \\n\\nLEADER Lay the burden of this task on some younger man.\\n\\nCREON Nay, watchers of the corpse have been found. \\n\\nLEADER What, then, is this further charge that thou wouldst give?\\n\\nCREON That ye side not with the breakers of these commands.\\n\\nLEADER No man is so foolish that he is enamoured of death.\\n\\nCREON In sooth, that is the meed; yet lucre hath oft ruined men through\\ntheir hopes.  (A GUARD enters from the spectators' left.)\\n\\nGUARD My liege, I will not say that I come breathless from speed,\\nor that have plied a nimble foot; for often did my thoughts make me\\npause, and wheel round in my path, to return. My mind was holding\\nlarge discourse with me; 'Fool, why goest thou to thy certain doom?'\\n'Wretch, tarrying again? And if Creon hears this from another, must\\nnot thou smart for it?' So debating, I went on my way with lagging\\nsteps, and thus a short road was made long. At last, however, it carried\\nthe day that I should come hither-to thee; and, though my tale be\\nnought, yet will I tell it; for I come with a good grip on one hope,-that\\nI can suffer nothing but what is my fate. \\n\\nCREON And what is it that disquiets thee thus? \\n\\nGUARD I wish to tell thee first about myself-I did not do the deed-I\\ndid not see the doer-it were not right that I should come to any harm.\\n\\nCREON Thou hast a shrewd eye for thy mark; well dost thou fence thyself\\nround against the blame; clearly thou hast some strange thing to tell.\\n\\nGUARD Aye, truly; dread news makes one pause long. \\n\\nCREON Then tell it, wilt thou, and so get thee gone? \\n\\nGUARD Well, this is it.-The corpse-some one hath just given it burial,\\nand gone away,-after sprinkling thirsty dust on the flesh, with such\\nother rites as piety enjoins. \\n\\nCREON What sayest thou? What living man hath dared this deed?\\n\\nGUARD I know\\n######################\\nOutput:\\n\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\":

(The following lines between ANTIGONE and the\\nCHORUS are chanted responsively.)  \\n\\nANTIGONE (strophe 1)\\n\\nSee me, citizens of my fatherland, setting forth on my last way,\\nlooking my last on the sunlight that is for me no more; no, Hades\\nwho gives sleep to all leads me living to Acheron's shore; who have\\nhad no portion in the chant that brings the bride, nor hath any song\\nbeen mine for the crowning of bridals; whom the lord of the Dark Lake\\nshall wed. \\n\\nCHORUS (systema 1)\\n\\nGlorious, therefore, and with praise, thou departest to that deep\\nplace of the dead: wasting sickness hath not smitten thee; thou hast\\nnot found the wages of the sword; no, mistress of thine own fate,\\nand still alive, thou shalt pass to Hades, as no other of mortal kind\\nhath passed. \\n\\nANTIGONE (antistrophe 1)\\n\\nI have heard in other days how dread a doom befell our Phrygian guest,\\nthe daughter of Tantalus, on the Sipylian heights; I how, like clinging\\nivy, the growth of stone subdued her; and the rains fail not, as men\\ntell, from her wasting form, nor fails the snow, while beneath her\\nweeping lids the tears bedew her bosom; and most like to hers is the\\nfate that brings me to my rest. \\n\\nCHORUS (systema 2)\\n\\nYet she was a goddess, thou knowest, and born of gods; we are mortals,\\nand of mortal race. But 'tis great renown for a woman who hath perished\\nthat she should have shared the doom of the godlike, in her life,\\nand afterward in death. \\n\\nANTIGONE (strophe 2)\\n\\nAh, I am mocked! In the name of our fathers' gods, can ye not wait\\ntill I am gone,-must ye taunt me to my face, O my city, and ye, her\\nwealthy sons? Ah, fount of Dirce, and thou holy ground of Thebe whose\\nchariots are many; ye, at least, will bear me witness, in what sort,\\nunwept of friends, and by what laws I pass to the rock-closed prison\\nof my strange tomb, ah me unhappy! who have no home on the earth or\\nin the shades, no home with the living or with the dead.\\n\\nCHORUS (strophe 3)\\n\\nThou hast rushed forward to the utmost verge of daring; and against\\nthat throne where justice sits on high thou hast fallen, my daughter,\\nwith a grievous fall. But in this ordeal thou art paying, haply, for\\nthy father's sin. \\n\\nANTIGONE (antistrophe 2)\\n\\nThou hast touched on my bitterest thought,-awaking the ever-new lament\\nfor my sire and for all the doom given to us, the famed house of Labdacus.\\nAlas for the horrors of the mother's bed! alas for the wretched mother's\\nslumber\\n######################\\nOutput:\\n\"}, {\"role\":

wealth or by war, by fenced city, or dark, sea-beaten ships.\\n\\n(antistrophe 1)\\n\\nAnd bonds tamed the son of Dryas, swift to wrath, that king of the\\nEdonians; so paid he for his frenzied taunts, when, by the will of\\nDionysus, he was pent in a rocky prison. There the fierce exuberance\\nof his madness slowly passed away. That man learned to know the god,\\nwhom in his frenzy he had provoked with mockeries; for he had sought\\nto quell the god-possessed women, and the Bacchanalian fire; and he\\nangered the Muses that love the flute. \\n\\n(strophe 2)\\n\\nAnd by the waters of the Dark Rocks, the waters of the twofold sea,\\nare the shores of Bosporus, and Thracian Salmydessus; where Ares,\\nneighbour to the city, saw the accurst, blinding wound dealt to the\\ntwo sons of Phineus by his fierce wife,-the wound that brought darkness\\nto those vengeance-craving orbs, smitten with her bloody hands, smitten\\nwith her shuttle for a dagger. \\n\\n(antistrophe 2)\\n\\nPining in their misery, they bewailed their cruel doom, those sons\\nof a mother hapless in her marriage; but she traced her descent from\\nthe ancient line of the Erechtheidae; and in far-distant caves she\\nwas nursed amid her father's storms, that child of Boreas, swift as\\na steed over the steep hills, a daughter of gods; yet upon her also\\nthe gray Fates bore hard, my daughter.

Am I going on the wofullest\\nway that ever I went? My son's voice greets me.-Go, my servants,-haste\\nye nearer, and when ye have reached the tomb, pass through the gap,\\nwhere the stones have been wrenched away, to the cell's very mouth,-and\\nlook. and see if 'tis Haemon's voice that I know, or if mine ear is\\ncheated by the gods.' \\n\\nThis search, at our despairing master's word, we went to make; and\\nin the furthest part of the tomb we descried her hanging by the neck,\\nslung by a thread-wrought halter of fine linen: while he was embracing\\nher with arms thrown around her waist, bewailing the loss of his bride\\nwho is with the dead, and his father's deeds, and his own ill-starred\\nlove. \\n\\nBut his father, when he saw him, cried aloud with a dread cry and\\nwent in, and called to him with a voice of wailing:-'Unhappy, what\\ndeed hast thou done! What thought hath come to thee? What manner of\\nmischance hath marred thy reason? Come forth, my child! I pray thee-I\\nimplore!' But the boy glared at him with fierce eyes, spat in his\\nface, and, without a word of answer, drew his cross-hilted sword:-as\\nhis father rushed forth in flight, he missed his aim;-then, hapless\\none, wroth with himself, he straightway leaned with all his weight\\nagainst his sword, and drove it, half its length, into his side; and,\\nwhile sense lingered, he clasped the maiden to his faint embrace,\\nand, as he gasped, sent forth on her pale cheek the swift stream of\\nthe oozing blood. \\n\\nCorpse enfolding corpse he lies; he hath won his nuptial rites, poor\\nyouth, not here, yet in the halls of Death; and he hath witnessed\\nto mankind that, of all curses which cleave to man, ill counsel is\\nthe sovereign curse.  (EURYDICE retires into the house.)\\n\\nLEADER What wouldst thou augur from this? The lady hath turned back,\\nand is gone, without a word, good or evil. \\n\\nMESSENGER I, too, am startled; yet I nourish the hope that, at these\\nsore tidings of her son, she cannot deign to give her sorrow public\\nvent, but in the privacy of the house will set her handmaids to mourn\\nthe household grief. For she is not untaught of discretion, that she\\nshould err. \\n\\nLEADER I know not; but to me, at least, a strained silence seems\\nto portend peril, no less than vain abundance of lament.\\n\\nMESSENGER Well, I will enter the house, and learn whether indeed\\nshe is not hiding some repressed purpose in the depths of a passionate\\nheart. Yea, thou sayest well: excess of silence, too, may have a perilous\\nmeaning.  (The MESSENGER goes into the palace. Enter CREON, on the\\nspectators' left, with attendants, carrying the shrouded body of HAEMON\\non bier. The following lines between CREON and the CHORUS are chanted\\nresponsively.)  \\n\\nCHORUS Lo, yonder the king himself draws near, bearing that which\\ntells too clear a tale,-the work of no stranger's madness,-if we may\\nsay it,-but of his own misdeeds. \\n\\nCREON (strophe 1)\\n\\nWoe for the sins of a darkened soul, stubborn sins, fraught with\\ndeath! Ah, ye behold us, the sire who hath slain, the son who hath\\nperished! Woe is me, for the wretched blindness of my counsels! Alas,\\nmy son, thou hast died in thy youth, by a timeless doom, woe is me!-thy\\nspirit hath fled,-not by thy folly, but by mine own! \\n\\nCHORUS (strophe 2)\\n\\nAh me, how all too late thou seemest to see the right! \\nCREON Ah me, I have learned the bitter lesson! But then, methinks,\\noh then, some god smote me from above with crushing weight, and hurled\\nme into ways of cruelty, woe is me,-overthrowing and trampling on\\nmy joy! Woe, woe, for the troublous toils of men!  (Enter MESSENGER\\nfrom the house.)  \\n\\nMESSENGER Sire, thou hast come, methinks, as one whose hands are\\nnot empty, but who hath store laid up besides; thou bearest yonder\\nburden with thee-and thou art soon to look upon the woes within thy\\nhouse. \\n\\nCREON And what worse ill is yet to follow upon ills? \\n\\nMESSENGER Thy queen hath died, true mother of yon corpse-ah, hapless\\nlady by blows newly dealt. \\n\\nCREON (antistrophe 1)\\n\\nOh Hades, all-receiving whom no sacrifice can appease! Hast thou,\\nthen, no mercy for me? O thou herald of evil, bitter tidings, what\\nword dost thou utter? Alas, I was already as dead, and thou hast smitten\\nme anew! What sayest thou, my son?

For when a house\\nhath once been shaken from heaven, there the curse fails nevermore,\\npassing from life to life of the race; even as, when the surge is\\ndriven over the darkness of the deep by the fierce breath of Thracian\\nsea-winds, it rolls up the black sand from the depths, and there is\\nsullen roar from wind-vexed headlands that front the blows of the\\nstorm. \\n\\n(antistrophe 1)\\n\\nI see that from olden time the sorrows in the house of the Labdacidae\\nare heaped upon the sorrows of the dead; and generation is not freed\\nby generation, but some god strikes them down, and the race hath no\\ndeliverance. \\n\\nFor now that hope of which the light had been spread above the last\\nroot of the house of Oedipus-that hope, in turn, is brought low--by\\nthe blood-stained dust due to the gods infernal, and by folly in speech,\\nand frenzy at the heart. \\n\\n(strophe 2)\\n\\nThy power, O Zeus, what human trespass can limit? That power which\\nneither Sleep, the all-ensnaring, nor the untiring months of the gods\\ncan master; but thou, a ruler to whom time brings not old age, dwellest\\nin the dazzling splendour of Olympus. \\n\\nAnd through the future, near and far, as through the past, shall this\\nlaw hold good: Nothing that is vast enters into the life of mortals\\nwithout a curse. \\n\\n(antistrophe 2)\\n\\nFor that hope whose wanderings are so wide is to many men a comfort,\\nbut to many a false lure of giddy desires; and the disappointment\\ncomes on one who knoweth nought till he burn his foot against the\\nhot fire. \\n\\nFor with wisdom hath some one given forth the famous saying, that\\nevil seems good, soon or late, to him whose mind the god draws to\\nmischief; and but for the briefest space doth he fare free of woe.\\n\\nLEADER OF THE CHORUS But lo, Haemon, the last of thy sons;-Comes\\nhe grieving for the doom of his promised bride, Antigone, and bitter\\nfor the baffled hope of his marriage?  (Enter HAEMON)  \\n\\nCREON We shall know soon, better than seers could tell us.-My son,\\nhearing the fixed doom of thy betrothed, art thou come in rage against\\nthy father? Or have I thy good will, act how I may? \\n\\nHAEMON Father, I am thine; and thou, in thy wisdom, tracest for me\\nrules which I shall follow. No marriage shall be deemed by me a greater\\ngain than thy good guidance. \\n\\nCREON Yea, this, my son, should be thy heart's fixed law,-in all\\nthings to obey thy father's will. 'Tis for this that men pray to see\\ndutiful children grow up around them in their homes,-that such may\\nrequite their father's foe with evil, and honour, as their father\\ndoth, his friend. But he who begets unprofitable children-what shall\\nwe say that he hath sown, but troubles for himself, and much triumph\\nfor his foes? Then do not thou, my son, at pleasure's beck, dethrone\\nthy reason for a woman's sake; knowing that this is a joy that soon\\ngrows cold in clasping arms,-an evil woman to share thy bed and thy\\nhome. For what wound could strike deeper than a false friend? Nay,\\nwith loathing, and as if she were thine enemy, let this girl go to\\nfind a husband in the house of Hades. For since I have taken her,\\nalone of all the city, in open disobedience, I will not make myself\\na liar to my people-I will slay her. \\n\\nSo let her appeal as she will to the majesty of kindred blood. If\\nI am to nurture mine own kindred in naughtiness, needs must I bear\\nwith it in aliens. He who does his duty in his own household will\\nbe found righteous in the State also. But if any one transgresses,\\nand does violence to the laws, or thinks to dictate to his rulers,\\nsuch an one can win no praise from me. No, whomsoever the city may\\nappoint, that man must be obeyed, in little things and great, in just\\nthings and unjust; and I should feel sure that one who thus obeys\\nwould be a good ruler no less than a good subject, and in the storm\\nof spears would stand his ground where he was set, loyal and dauntless\\nat his comrade's side. \\n\\nBut disobedience is the worst of evils. This it is that ruins cities;\\nthis makes homes desolate; by this, the ranks of allies are broken\\ninto head-long rout; but, of the lives whose course is fair, the greater\\npart owes safety to obedience. Therefore we must support the cause\\nof order, and in no wise suffer a woman to worst us. Better to fall\\nfrom power, if we must, by a man's hand; then we should not be called\\nweaker than a woman. \\n\\nLEADER To us, unless our years have stolen our wit, thou seemest\\nto say wisely what thou sayest. \\n\\nHAEMON Father, the gods implant reason in men, the highest of all\\nthings that we call our own.

Better to fall\\nfrom power, if we must, by a man's hand; then we should not be called\\nweaker than a woman. \\n\\nLEADER To us, unless our years have stolen our wit, thou seemest\\nto say wisely what thou sayest. \\n\\nHAEMON Father, the gods implant reason in men, the highest of all\\nthings that we call our own. Not mine the skill-far from me be the\\nquest!-to say wherein thou speakest not aright; and yet another man,\\ntoo, might have some useful thought. At least, it is my natural office\\nto watch, on thy behalf, all that men say, or do, or find to blame.\\nFor the dread of thy frown forbids the citizen to speak such words\\nas would offend thine ear; but can hear these murmurs in the dark,\\nthese moanings of the city for this maiden; 'no woman,' they say,\\n'ever merited her doom less,-none ever was to die so shamefully for\\ndeeds so glorious as hers; who, when her own brother had fallen in\\nbloody strife, would not leave him unburied, to be devoured by carrion\\ndogs, or by any bird:-deserves not she the meed of golden honour?'\\n\\nSuch is the darkling rumour that spreads in secret. For me, my father,\\nno treasure is so precious as thy welfare. What, indeed, is a nobler\\nornament for children than a prospering sire's fair fame, or for sire\\nthan son's? Wear not, then, one mood only in thyself; think not that\\nthy word, and thine alone, must be right. For if any man thinks that\\nhe alone is wise,-that in speech, or in mind, he hath no peer,-such\\na soul, when laid open, is ever found empty. \\n\\nNo, though a man be wise, 'tis no shame for him to learn many things,\\nand to bend in season. Seest thou, beside the wintry torrent's course,\\nhow the trees that yield to it save every twig, while the stiff-necked\\nperish root and branch? And even thus he who keeps the sheet of his\\nsail taut, and never slackens it, upsets his boat, and finishes his\\nvoyage with keel uppermost. \\n\\nNay, forego thy wrath; permit thyself to change. For if I, a younger\\nman, may offer my thought, it were far best, I ween, that men should\\nbe all-wise by nature; but, otherwise-and oft the scale inclines not\\nso-'tis good also to learn from those who speak aright. \\n\\nLEADER Sire, 'tis meet that thou shouldest profit by his words, if\\nhe speaks aught in season, and thou, Haemon, by thy father's; for\\non both parts there hath been wise speech. \\n\\nCREON Men of my age are we indeed to be schooled, then, by men of\\nhis? \\n\\nHAEMON In nothing that is not right; but if I am young, thou shouldest\\nlook to my merits, not to my years. \\n\\nCREON Is it a merit to honour the unruly? \\n\\nHAEMON I could wish no one to show respect for evil-doers.\\n\\nCREON Then is not she tainted with that malady? \\n\\nHAEMON Our Theban folk, with one voice, denies it. \\n\\nCREON Shall Thebes prescribe to me how I must rule? \\n\\nHAEMON See, there thou hast spoken like a youth indeed.\\n\\nCREON Am I to rule this land by other judgment than mine own?\\n\\nHAEMON That is no city which belongs to one man. \\n\\nCREON Is not the city held to be the ruler's? \\n\\nHAEMON Thou wouldst make a good monarch of a desert. \\n\\nCREON This boy, it seems, is the woman's champion. \\n\\nHAEMON If thou art a woman; indeed, my care is for thee.\\n\\nCREON Shameless, at open feud with thy father! \\n\\nHAEMON Nay, I see thee offending against justice. \\n\\nCREON Do I offend, when I respect mine own prerogatives?\\n\\nHAEMON Thou dost not respect them, when thou tramplest on the gods'\\nhonours, \\n\\nCREON O dastard nature, yielding place to woman! \\n\\nHAEMON Thou wilt never find me yield to baseness. \\n\\nCREON All thy words, at least, plead for that girl. \\n\\nHAEMON And for thee, and for me, and for the gods below.\\n\\nCREON Thou canst never marry her, on this side the grave.\\n\\nHAEMON Then she must die, and in death destroy another.\\n\\nCREON How! doth thy boldness run to open threats? \\n\\nHAEMON What threat is it, to combat vain resolves? \\n\\nCREON Thou shalt rue thy witless teaching of wisdom. \\n\\nHAEMON Wert thou not my father, I would have called thee unwise.\\n\\nCREON Thou woman's slave, use not wheedling speech with me.\\n\\nHAEMON Thou wouldest speak, and then hear no reply? \\n\\nCREON Sayest thou so? Now, by the heaven above us-be sure of it-thou\\nshalt smart for taunting me in this opprobrious strain. Bring forth\\nthat hated thing, that she may die forthwith in his presence-before\\nhis eyes-at her bridegroom's side! \\n\\nHAEMON No, not at my side-never think it-shall she perish; nor shalt\\nthou ever set eyes more upon my face:-rave, then, with such friends\\nas can endure thee.

The husband lost, another\\nmight have been found, and child from another, to replace the first-born:\\nbut, father and mother hidden with Hades, no brother's life could\\never bloom for me again. Such was the law whereby I held thee first\\nin honour; but Creon deemed me guilty of error therein, and of outrage,\\nah brother mine! And now he leads me thus, a captive in his hands;\\nno bridal bed, no bridal song hath been mine, no joy of marriage,\\nno portion in the nurture of children; but thus, forlorn of friends,\\nunhappy one, I go living to the vaults of death. \\n\\nAnd what law of heaven have I transgressed?

character,personality_trait,scene,interaction,motivation\\nText: some strange thing to tell.\\n\\nGUARD Aye, truly; dread news makes one pause long. \\n\\nCREON Then tell it, wilt thou, and so get thee gone? \\n\\nGUARD Well, this is it.-The corpse-some one hath just given it burial,\\nand gone away,-after sprinkling thirsty dust on the flesh, with such\\nother rites as piety enjoins. \\n\\nCREON What sayest thou? What living man hath dared this deed?\\n\\nGUARD I know not; no stroke of pickaxe was seen there, no earth thrown\\nup by mattock; the ground was hard and dry, unbroken, without track\\nof wheels; the doer was one who had left no trace. And when the first\\nday-watchman showed it to us, sore wonder fell on all. The dead man\\nwas veiled from us; not shut within a tomb, but lightly strewn with\\ndust, as by the hand of one who shunned a curse. And no sign met the\\neye as though any beast of prey or any dog had come nigh to him, or\\ntorn him. \\n\\nThen evil words flew fast and loud among us, guard accusing guard;\\nund it would e'en have come to blows at last, nor was there any to\\nhinder. Every man was the culprit, and no one was convicted, but all\\ndisclaimed knowledge of the deed. And we were ready to take red-hot\\niron in our hands;-to walk through fire;-to make oath by the gods\\nthat we had not done the deed,-that we were not privy to the planning\\nor the doing. \\n\\nAt last, when all our searching was fruitless, one spake, who made\\nus all bend our faces on the earth in fear; for we saw not how we\\ncould gainsay him, or escape mischance if we obeyed. His counsel was\\nthat this deed must be reported to thee, and not hidden. And this\\nseemed best; and the lot doomed my hapless self to win this prize.\\nSo here I stand,-as unwelcome as unwilling, well I wot; for no man\\ndelights in the bearer of bad news. \\n\\nLEADER O king, my thoughts have long been whispering, can this deed,\\nperchance, be e'en the work of gods? \\n\\nCREON Cease, ere thy words fill me utterly with wrath, lest thou\\nbe found at once an old man and foolish. For thou sayest what is not\\nto be borne, in saying that the gods have care for this corpse. Was\\nit for high reward of trusty service that they sought to hide his\\nnakedness, who came to burn their pillared shrines and sacred treasures,\\nto burn their land, and scatter its laws to the winds? Or dost thou\\nbehold the gods honouring the wicked? It cannot be. No! From the first\\nthere were certain in the town that muttered against me, chafing at\\nthis edict, wagging their heads in secret; and kept not their necks\\nduly under the yoke, like men contented with my sway. \\n\\n'Tis by them, well I know, that these have been beguiled and bribed\\nto do this deed. Nothing so evil as money ever grew to be current\\namong men. This lays cities low, this drives men from their homes,\\nthis trains and warps honest souls till they set themselves to works\\nof shame; this still teaches folk to practise villainies, and to know\\nevery godless deed. \\n\\nBut all the men who wrought this thing for hire have made it sure\\nthat, soon or late, they shall pay the price. Now, as Zeus still hath\\nmy reverence, know this-I tell it thee on my oath:-If ye find not\\nthe very author of this burial, and produce him before mine eyes,\\ndeath alone shall not be enough for you, till first, hung up alive,\\nye have revealed this outrage,-that henceforth ye may thieve with\\nbetter knowledge whence lucre should be won, and learn that it is\\nnot well to love gain from every source. For thou wilt find that ill-gotten\\npelf brings more men to ruin than to weal. \\n\\nGUARD May I speak? Or shall I just turn and go? \\n\\nCREON Knowest thou not that even now thy voice offends?\\n\\nGUARD Is thy smart in the ears, or in the soul? \\n\\nCREON And why wouldst thou define the seat of my pain? \\n\\nGUARD The doer vexes thy mind, but I, thine ears. \\n\\nCREON Ah, thou art a born babbler, 'tis well seen. \\n\\nGUARD May be, but never the doer of this deed. \\n\\nCREON Yea, and more,-the seller of thy life for silver.\\n\\nGUARD Alas! 'Tis sad, truly, that he who judges should misjudge.\\n\\nCREON Let thy fancy play with 'judgment' as it will;-but, if ye show\\nme not the doers of these things, ye shall avow that dastardly gains\\nwork sorrows.  (CREON goes into the palace.)  \\n\\nGUARD Well, may he be found! so 'twere best. But, be he caught or\\nbe he not-fortune must settle that-truly thou wilt not see me here\\nagain. Saved, even now, beyond hope and thought, I owe the gods great\\nthanks.

For \\n\\nCREON was blest once, as I count bliss; he had saved this land of\\nCadmus from its foes; he was clothed with sole dominion in the land;\\nhe reigned, the glorious sire of princely children. And now all hath\\nbeen lost. For when a man hath forfeited his pleasures, I count him\\nnot as living,-I hold him but a breathing corpse.

Even as I was loosing\\nthe fastenings of the gate, to open it, the message of a household\\nwoe smote on mine ear: I sank back, terror-stricken, into the arms\\nof my handmaids, and my senses fled. But say again what the tidings\\nwere; I shall hear them as one who is no stranger to sorrow.\\n\\nMESSENGER Dear lady, I will witness of what I saw, and will leave\\nno word of the truth untold. Why, indeed, should I soothe thee with\\nwords in which must presently be found false? Truth is ever best.-I\\nattended thy lord as his guide to the furthest part of the plain,\\nwhere the body of Polyneices, torn by dogs, still lay unpitied. We\\nprayed the goddess of the roads, and Pluto, in mercy to restrain their\\nwrath; we washed the dead with holy washing; and with freshly-plucked\\nboughs we solemnly burned such relics as there were. We raised a high\\nmound of his native earth; and then we turned away to enter the maiden's\\nnuptial chamber with rocky couch, the caverned mansion of the bride\\nof Death. And, from afar off, one of us heard a voice of loud wailing\\nat that bride's unhallowed bower; and came to tell our master Creon.\\n\\nAnd as the king drew nearer, doubtful sounds of a bitter cry floated\\naround him; he groaned, and said in accents of anguish, 'Wretched\\nthat I am, can my foreboding be true? Am I going on the wofullest\\nway that ever I went? My son's voice greets me.-Go, my servants,-haste\\nye nearer, and when ye have reached the tomb, pass through the gap,\\nwhere the stones have been wrenched away, to the cell's very mouth,-and\\nlook.

For each identified entity, extract the following information:\\n- entity_name: Name of the entity (e.g., \\\"Openness_In_Book_Discussion\\\" for a trait manifestation, \\\"Garden_Confrontation\\\" for a scene)\\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [character,personality_trait,scene,interaction,motivation]\\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description including:\\n  * For traits: Which Big Five dimension, how it manifests\\n  * For behaviors: Specific actions/responses showing the trait\\n  * For scenes: Context and situation details\\n  * For triggers: What caused the trait expression\\n  * For development: How the trait has changed\\nAdditionally, ensure that the following personality trait entities are ALWAYS included:\\n\\na) The five core Big Five traits as primary personality nodes:\\n   \\\"Openness\\\", \\\"Conscientiousness\\\", \\\"Extraversion\\\", \\\"Agreeableness\\\", \\\"Neuroticism\\\"\\n\\nb) For each Big Five dimension, extract at least 2-3 specific facet traits from openness: creativity, curiosity, open-mindedness, artistic_interests, emotional_awareness\\nconscientiousness: organization, responsibility, self_discipline, achievement_striving, cautiousness\\nextraversion: sociability, assertiveness, energy_level, excitement_seeking, cheerfulness\\nagreeableness: trust, cooperation, altruism, modesty, empathy\\nneuroticism: anxiety, emotional_stability, self_consciousness, stress_sensitivity, moodiness that are most evident in Antigone's behavior.\\n\\nc) Each trait entity description must include:\\n   - Clear definition of the trait as applied to Antigone\\n   - Examples of how this trait manifests in their behavior\\n   - Indication of the trait's strength (high, moderate, or low)\\n   - Any notable changes or development in this trait throughout the narrative\\n\\nFormat each entity as (\\\"entity\\\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\\n\\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs that are clearly related to each other.\\nFor each pair of related entities, extract:\\n- source_entity: name of the source entity (e.g., a trait)\\n- target_entity: name of the target entity (e.g., a behavior or scene)\\n- relationship_description: How these entities connect in showing Antigone's personality\\n- relationship_strength: Score from 1-10 showing how strongly this relationship demonstrates the trait\\n- relationship_keywords: Key themes about this personality trait \\n\\nEnsure the following relationship types are represented:\\na) Antigone to each Big Five trait (e.g., \\\"Antigone to Openness\\\")\\nb) Each Big Five trait to its relevant facets (e.g., \\\"Openness to Creativity\\\")\\nc) Each Big Five trait to supporting scenes (e.g., \\\"Extraversion to Party_Scene\\\")\\nd) Each Big Five trait to relevant motivations (e.g., \\\"Conscientiousness to Achievement_Drive\\\")\\n\\nFormat each relationship as (\\\"relationship\\\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_keywords><|><relationship_strength>)\\n\\n3.Graph Structure Requirement:\\nEnsure that the generated knowledge graph is centered on Antigone with the Big Five personality traits as primary nodes:\\n    a) Every core Big Five personality trait (\\\"Openness\\\", \\\"Conscientiousness\\\", \\\"Extraversion\\\", \\\"Agreeableness\\\", \\\"Neuroticism\\\") MUST be directly connected to the Antigone node through strong relationship edges.\\n   \\n    b) All scene, interaction, and motivation entities MUST be connected to at least one Big Five personality trait node, showing how they demonstrate or relate to that specific trait.\\n   \\n    c) For each Big Five trait, identify at least 2-3 specific facets (from the provided dimensions list) that are most prominently displayed by Antigone and connect them as sub-traits.\\n   \\n    d) Prioritize creating meaningful relationships that illustrate how specific scenes, interactions, or motivations demonstrate or reinforce particular personality traits.\\n\\n4. Identify high-level key words that summarize the main personality traits and their development shown in the text.\\nFormat as (\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|><high_level_keywords>)\\n\\n5.

nestlings.\\nSo she also, when she saw the corpse bare, lifted up a voice of wailing,\\nand called down curses on the doers of that deed. And straightway\\nshe brought thirsty dust in her hands; and from a shapely ewer of\\nbronze, held high, with thrice-poured drink-offering she crowned the\\ndead. \\n\\nWe rushed forward when we saw it, and at once dosed upon our quarry,\\nwho was in no wise dismayed. Then we taxed her with her past and present\\ndoings; and she stood not on denial of aught,-at once to my joy and\\nto my pain. To have escaped from ills one's self is a great joy; but\\n'tis painful to bring friends to ill. Howbeit, all such things are\\nof less account to me than mine own safety. \\n\\nCREON Thou-thou whose face is bent to earth-dost thou avow, or disavow,\\nthis deed? \\n\\nANTIGONE I avow it; I make no denial. \\n\\nCREON  (to GUARD) Thou canst betake thee whither thou wilt, free\\nand clear of a grave charge.  (Exit GUARD, To ANTIGONE)  Now, tell\\nme thou-not in many words, but briefly-knewest thou that an edict\\nhad forbidden this? \\n\\nANTIGONE I knew it: could I help it? It was public. \\n\\nCREON And thou didst indeed dare to transgress that law?\\n\\nANTIGONE Yes; for it was not Zeus that had published me that edict;\\nnot such are the laws set among men by the justice who dwells with\\nthe gods below; nor deemed I that thy decrees were of such force,\\nthat a mortal could override the unwritten and unfailing statutes\\nof heaven. For their life is not of to-day or yesterday, but from\\nall time, and no man knows when they were first put forth.\\n\\nNot through dread of any human pride could I answer to the gods for\\nbreaking these. Die I must,-I knew that well (how should I not?)-even\\nwithout thy edicts. But if I am to die before my time, I count that\\na gain: for when any one lives, as I do, compassed about with evils,\\ncan such an one find aught but gain in death? \\n\\nSo for me to meet this doom is trifling grief; but if I had suffered\\nmy mother's son to lie in death an unburied corpse, that would have\\ngrieved me; for this, I am not grieved. And if my present deeds are\\nfoolish in thy sight, it may be that a foolish judge arraigns my folly.\\n\\nLEADER OF THE CHORUS The maid shows herself passionate child of passionate\\nsire, and knows not how to bend before troubles. \\n\\nCREON Yet I would have thee know that o'er-stubborn spirits are most\\noften humbled; 'tis the stiffest iron, baked to hardness in the fire,\\nthat thou shalt oftenest see snapped and shivered; and I have known\\nhorses that show temper brought to order by a little curb; there is\\nno room for pride when thou art thy neighbour's slave.-This girl was\\nalready versed in insolence when she transgressed the laws that had\\nbeen set forth; and, that done, lo, a second insult,-to vaunt of this,\\nand exult in her deed. \\n\\nNow verily I am no man, she is the man, if this victory shall rest\\nwith her, and bring no penalty. No! be she sister's child, or nearer\\nto me in blood than any that worships Zeus at the altar of our house,-she\\nand her kinsfolk shall not avoid a doom most dire; for indeed I charge\\nthat other with a like share in the plotting of this burial.\\n\\nAnd summon her-for I saw her e'en now within,-raving, and not mistress\\nof her wits. So oft, before the deed, the mind stands self-convicted\\nin its treason, when folks are plotting mischief in the dark. But\\nverily this, too, is hateful,-when one who hath been caught in wickednes\\nthen seeks to make the crime a glory. \\n\\nANTIGONE Wouldst thou do more than take and slay me? \\n\\nCREON No more, indeed; having that, I have all. \\n\\nANTIGONE Why then dost thou delay? In thy discourse there is nought\\nthat pleases me,-never may there be!-and so my words must needs be\\nunpleasing to thee. And yet, for glory-whence could I have won a nobler,\\nthan by giving burial to mine own brother? All here would own that\\nthey thought it well, were not their lips sealed by fear. But royalty,\\nblest in so much besides, hath the power to do and say what it will.\\n\\nCREON Thou differest from all these Thebans in that view.\\n\\nANTIGONE These also share it; but they curb their tongues for thee.\\n\\nCREON And art thou not ashamed to act apart from them? \\n\\nANTIGONE No; there is nothing shameful in piety to a brother.\\n\\nCREON Was it not a brother, too, that died in the opposite cause?\\n\\nANTIGONE Brother by the same mother and the same sire. \\n\\nCREON Why, then, dost thou render a grace that is impious in his\\nsight? \\n\\nANTIGONE The dead man will not

ELDERS\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe same as in Oedipus the King, an open space before the royal palace,\\nonce that of Oedipus, at Thebes. The backscene represents the front\\nof the palace, with three doors, of which the central and largest\\nis the principal entrance into the house. The time is at daybreak\\non the morning after the fall of the two brothers, Eteocles and Polyneices,\\nand the flight of the defeated Argives. ANTIGONE calls ISMENE forth\\nfrom the palace, in order to speak to her alone.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nANTIGONE Ismene, sister, mine own dear sister, knowest thou what\\nill there is, of all bequeathed by Oedipus, that Zeus fulfils not\\nfor us twain while we live? Nothing painful is there, nothing fraught\\nwith ruin, no shame, no dishonour, that I have not seen in thy woes\\nand mine. \\n\\nAnd now what new edict is this of which they tell, that our Captain\\nhath just published to all Thebes? Knowest thou aught? Hast thou heard?\\nOr is it hidden from thee that our friends are threatened with the\\ndoom of our foes? \\n\\nISMENE No word of friends, Antigone, gladsome or painful, hath come\\nto me, since we two sisters were bereft of brothers twain, killed\\nin one day by twofold blow; and since in this last night the Argive\\nhost hath fled, know no more, whether my fortune be brighter, or more\\ngrievous. \\n\\nANTIGONE I knew it well, and therefore sought to bring thee beyond\\nthe gates of the court, that thou mightest hear alone. \\n\\nISMENE What is it? 'Tis plain that thou art brooding on some dark\\ntidings. \\n\\nANTIGONE What, hath not Creon destined our brothers, the one to honoured\\nburial, the other to unburied shame? Eteocles, they say, with due\\nobservance of right and custom, he hath laid in the earth, for his\\nhonour among the dead below. But the hapless corpse of Polyneices-as\\nrumour saith, it hath been published to the town that none shall entomb\\nhim or mourn, but leave unwept, unsepulchred, a welcome store for\\nthe birds, as they espy him, to feast on at will. \\n\\nSuch, 'tis said, is the edict that the good Creon hath set forth for\\nthee and for me,-yes, for me,-and is coming hither to proclaim it\\nclearly to those who know it not; nor counts the matter light, but,\\nwhoso disobeys in aught, his doom is death by stoning before all the\\nfolk. Thou knowest it now; and thou wilt soon show whether thou art\\nnobly bred, or the base daughter of a noble line. \\n\\nISMENE Poor sister,-and if things stand thus, what could I help to\\ndo or undo? \\n\\nANTIGONE Consider if thou wilt share the toil and the deed.\\n\\nISMENE In what venture? What can be thy meaning? \\n\\nANTIGONE Wilt thou aid this hand to lift the dead? \\n\\nISMENE Thou wouldst bury him,-when 'tis forbidden to Thebes?\\n\\nANTIGONE I will do my part,-and thine, if thou wilt not,-to a brother.\\nFalse to him will I never be found. \\n\\nISMENE Ah, over-bold! when Creon hath forbidden? \\n\\nANTIGONE Nay, he hath no right to keep me from mine own.\\n\\nISMENE Ah me! think, sister, how our father perished, amid hate and\\nscorn, when sins bared by his own search had moved him to strike both\\neyes with self-blinding hand; then the mother wife, two names in one,\\nwith twisted noose did despite unto her life; and last, our two brothers\\nin one day,-each shedding, hapless one, a kinsman's blood,-wrought\\nout with mutual hands their common doom. And now we in turn-we two\\nleft all alone think how we shall perish, more miserably than all\\nthe rest, if, in defiance of the law, we brave a king's decree or\\nhis powers. Nay, we must remember, first, that we were born women,\\nas who should not strive with men; next, that we are ruled of the\\nstronger, so that we must obey in these things, and in things yet\\nsorer. I, therefore, asking the Spirits Infernal to pardon, seeing\\nthat force is put on me herein, will hearken to our rulers. for 'tis\\nwitless to be over busy. \\n\\nANTIGONE I will not urge thee,-no nor, if thou yet shouldst have\\nthe mind, wouldst thou be welcome as a worker with me. Nay, be what\\nthou wilt; but I will bury him: well for me to die in doing that.\\nI shall rest, a loved one with him whom I have loved, sinless in my\\ncrime; for I owe a longer allegiance to the dead than to the living:\\nin that world I shall abide for ever.
